**I'm a data analyst with 3 years of experience in hypothesis driven research with strong skills in data-wrangling, statistical analysis, and data visualization.**

I'm currently a Data Analyst at [wikiHow](https://www.wikihow.com/Main-Page) and am responsible for analytical projects such as A/B tests, analytics reporting in `R Shiny`, evaluating content performance. I've worked in a wide-range of data driven roles such as an undergraduate researcher in [applied statistics](https://karenamckinnon.github.io/group.html) at UCLA, a data analyst intern at General Mills, a research assistant at Stanford, and an intern at NASA Ames.  

### :computer: Professional Interests

I'm interested in opportunities at technology, social media, and data oriented companies to apply my skills in data analysis and programming. I'm well-versed in Python, R, SQL, Excel and at learning new tools on the job. I enjoy working with both technical and non-technical stakeholders and love a good challenge.

### :sparkles: Data Visualization

My passion for data, design and coding is a perfect combination for all types of data visualization. By contributing to challenges such as [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/christopher-reed/tidytuesday), I'm constantly strengthening my skills in design and reproducible data visualization with `{matplotlib}` and `{seaborn}`. I'm also comfortable with visualizing data using R Shiny and `{ggplot}`.
